# APC
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C-based project developed to perform arithmetic operations on extremely large integers that exceed the limits of standard data types. Traditional data types such as int or long long are restricted by fixed memory sizes, making them unsuitable for handling very large numbers.

Features:
 Supports very large integers (no size limitation)
 Addition of large numbers
 Subtraction of large numbers
 Multiplication
 Division
 Digit-by-digit computation
 Dynamic memory allocation
 Modular and structured code design
 Error handling and input validation

Key Concepts Used:
Singly/Doubly Linked Lists
Pointers and Structures
Manual arithmetic algorithms
Carry & borrow handling
Memory optimization
Modular programming

How It Works:
Each number is stored as a linked list.
Every node contains a single digit.
Arithmetic operations are performed digit-by-digit.
Results are stored in a new linked list and displayed to the user.
This approach removes the size limitation of built-in data types and allows handling of very large values efficiently.

Learning Outcomes:
Improved understanding of low-level C programming
Strong knowledge of linked lists and pointers
Experience with dynamic memory management
Developed problem-solving skills for large number computations
Hands-on practice with modular project design
