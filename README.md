# APC
The Arbitrary Precision Calculator (APC) is a C-based project developed to perform arithmetic operations on extremely large integers that exceed the limits of standard data types. Traditional data types such as int or long long are restricted by fixed memory sizes, making them unsuitable for handling very large numbers.
